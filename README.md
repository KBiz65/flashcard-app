## Summary

The Flash-o-matic app was created with React and is a useful flashcard app that takes your flashcards to the digital age.

An easy to use app that lets the user create, edit, and delete decks of flashcards. It will also allow the user to create, edit, and delete actual cards within each deck. As long as the deck has a minimum of three cards in it the user can choose the study option. Studying the cards in the deck will show the front of the card. When the user thinks they have the right answer they flip the card over to see if they were correct. They can then choose to flip the card back over to the front again or move on to the next card. Once all cards have been shown they will be prompted to either start over or it will take them back to the home screen that shows all available decks. 

This app was a great way to get much more comfortable with using React Hooks as well as styling with Bootstrap.
